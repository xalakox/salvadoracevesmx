Pushing information using direct media has been widely used on audiences since I can remember, with the commodity of communications and connections between peers, every audience has it's own audience that nourishes it from a narcissists stand, entertainment, cultural positioning and association; it is this association from where a new subset of advertising plans emerge taking advantage of new connections not widely used for a variety of risks.

Market research provides a basis for planning and measurement of effective advertising campaigns and the effectiveness of such measurements rely on the understanding of our target; the same questions about our target evolve from early stages in advertising campaigns, doing a good job on defining location, demographics, socio-economic and age groups are one of many pillars for starting a business marketing plan; however we have to consider the psychographic and behavioural segmentation.

Psychographic segmentation is the association of similar attitudes, values and lifestyles that can lead our target to buy whatever we might be selling, with the rise of big-data measurements and social media usage in a widespread, those associations have become more effectively measured, we must approach them thinking not about how the audience that will buy the product will look like but rather on what interests that market has and under what situations we can become much more relevant.

Using today's tools we can know what interests people that end-up buying our competition and similar market offers are being used and the only way to do that is to integrate past and present conversation behaviours to capitalize the not-so-obvious spaces that can produce a mayor difference for conversion than a widespread generic campaign.

Back in the 90s with the growth of syndicated ad-serving tools such as Google Adsense and the continued growth of its market, such integration became a science on itself, one of the cases was used to cross-reference what type of websites an audience that end up on a car rental site where visiting and revealed a not so obvious answer for car rental companies (that is airplane ticket websites and hotel reservations that are high value spaces) where obituary pages of newspapers and sport-tickets web sites, such properties where not under the radar for them to buy and where in fact low cost source for high conversion traffic.

Nowadays such correlations can be measured by defining what behaviour we want to be related to, and then address not just that answer but rather a wide variety of interests that lead to a specific set of actions, this insights can be used to maximize conversion rather than just throwing money to a high volume media.

The behavioural segmentation on times of big-data is brand association, meaning to what I want to become associated and by achieving such association it increases loyalty and identity for our audience perception of the brand; for example, selling running shoes can be challenging on a high competition market and to what activities I want to be associated is crucial in such market, classic approach includes looking into being associated with high profile athletes however opportunity has grown to be related to specifics such as city running, marathon running or even cross-fit that can be more about teamwork; people that run 5k every day have interests that tell us what their goal of association is, and by measuring their conversation and finding their common interests we can more effectively attach our brand to that objective rather that impose our own vision of the ideal consumer.
